            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, ſuſtained and endured. In the yeares of
our Lord 1609. and 1610. all contentions and controuerſies were fully
pacifyed and ended; and to that end, by the Letters Patents of

clemencie, at his entry into the raigne of this his Kingdome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
manner and ancient cuſtome of the Land, not onely generally, but ſpecially
ratified and confirmed.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, the aforeſaid common enemies, as well of the
King, and this Kingdome, as of all peace and quietneſſe, haue ſpared no
meanes, paines, nor labour, to deuiſe and practiſe, not onely, how, and
which way, they might procure the breach and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilating of the ſaid moſt
deſired and confirmed Peace; but alſo to effect their euill, wicked, and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious purpoſes and intents, ſecretly practiſed againſt this
Kingdome, and the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And to that end, (when the ſaid Peace
and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was fully ratified and confirmed) reiecting all other points, not
onely refuſed to agree vnto the ſaid Letters Patents, and Peace made; but
alſo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denyed to ſubſcribe vnto the <hi>Amneſtia,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we, by the late Emperours <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> of famous memory, conſent, were
fully and wholly reconciled together, and all reuenge and euill will to
ſurceaſe and be ended) but rather ſought by all the meanes they could
practiſe and deuiſe, wholly and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſſolue and exterminate
the ſame; and to many men daily ſhewed their wicked and malicious intent:
whereas before they were not onely ſecret,
<pb facs="tcp:17011:4"/>but in many cauſes and actions, open enemies vnto
this their natiue Country, going about to bereaue and take from our preſent
Lord and ſoueraigne King, the aſſignation of this Kingdome, and to
tranſ-fer the ſame vnto another: But when they could not effect the ſame,
and their hopes therein were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fruſtrated (for that, by Gods mercy,
in his time appointed, all things by the commandement of the Emperours
Maieſtie, our ſoueraigne Lord and King, were fully confirmed) they
proceeded ſo far, through the procurement of the Ieſuites, and others their
adherents; againe by many ſlanderous reports, and cenſures, both by word of
mouth, and writing, to publiſh and proclaime all thoſe in this Kingdome
that receiue the Communion vnder both Kindes, to be notorious Heretikes: with
whom, according to a maxime of their Papiſticall doctrine, they are not bound
(as they teach) to keep or hold any faith or promiſe: giuing alſo diuers
other new-fayned, and infamous names, both vnto vs, and the doctrine of the
Goſpell, to the great contempt of our Religion of receiuing vnder both
kindes; and not onely that, but alſo in their ſcandalous writings affirme,
all thoſe that vſe the ſame Religion, as alſo, all that are not
conformable to the Romiſh Religion, to bee worthy of, and to haue deſerued
all kinde of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and puniſhment; animating the Secular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
with fire and ſword, to perſecute all thoſe that profeſſe the
receiuing of the Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kindes.</p>
            <p>And the better to deceiue the ſimpler ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to
ſet diuiſion and enemity betweene thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:17011:4"/>of the reformed Religion: the ſaid enemies of this
Kingdome, and the common peace thereof, ſought to ſet thoſe whom we, by
the Kings Maieſties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, and his Graces ſpeciall Conſent,
had made Protectors and Super-intendents of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, at variance: by that
meanes not onely vtterly to with-draw them from their functions, but alſo
wholly to ſubuert and ouerthrow our Religion. For in open Aſſemblies,
when by meanes of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſecret conſpiracies, they had ſowed
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and hatred among thoſe of our Religion: when the ſaid Vnion for
Religion on our parts was made, and his Maieſties Letters Patents in
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rehearſed, as alſo a generall confirmation of all our
immunities, and priuiledges of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, confirmed by his ſacred
Maieſtie our King now raigning, were in <hi>ſpecie</hi> related;
(purpoſely to further their wicked and malicious intents:) they were by them
diuerſly and contrarily interpreted. Sometime with great promiſes, and then
againe with threatnings of incurring the Emperours Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties indignation,
they ſought to diſſwade and terrifie the ſaid Super-intendents from
perſeuering in the protection by them vndertaken: and by that meanes made
ſuch as in their profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were not well grounded and
confirmed, to doubt and to wauer; bringing others, by promiſes and hopes of
dignities, to yeeld to them, by fearing and doubting to be wholly diſgraced
and reiected of men, as alſo not to loſe the benefite of earthly
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; and ſo, ere they were aware, forſaking the Truth once by them
acknowledged and receiued,
<pb facs="tcp:17011:5"/>fell from the ſame, to ioyne with them in their
erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious doctrine.</p>
            <p>Then proceeding further, hauing gotten and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained higher
Offices and Dignities, not onely by Princely authority, and vertue of their
Offices, but alſo by the Emperours Maieſties Regents, they found meanes to
diſplace and thruſt diuers old and well-deſeruing perſons of the
Kingdome out of their Offices, and in the ſame to put other Captaines and
adherents of their owne Religion, and by them troubled and moleſted the
people for Religion: cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, vnder pretence of temporall offences, to
be puniſhed and tormented. And ſuch Miniſters as, by authority from his
Maieſtie, were permitted to preach the Reformed Religion, in diuers Villages,
they likewiſe diſplaced, and put others therein of the contrary Religion.
And in the Townes of Prague, they alſo tooke ſuch order, that thoſe of
the Papiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Religion obtained the chiefeſt Offices, who by ſubtill
practiſes and threatnings, found meanes by their importunities, to deale in
ſuch ſort with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Officers, and Counſellers of the reformed
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they were conſtrained to do whatſoeuer they deſired and
commanded.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch therefore, as that it toucheth vs the Burghemaſters
and Councell, both of the old, new, and leſſer Townes of Prague, which are
of the Bohemian Profeſſion, and communicate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds: That whereas
we and our Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, as alſo the reſt of the Cities
profeſſing the Religion, by a full conſent and agreement made by them and
vs, vnder our hands and Seales, at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb facs="tcp:17011:5"/>Meeting, when any thing was to bee done and handled
touching the Letters Patents, and the liberty of Religion, the principalleſt
perſons of the ſaid Townes and Religion, as alſo of all other Townes of
the ſame Profeſsion, bound themſelues faithfully to aide and aſsiſt
one the other therein, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of incurring perpetuall ſhame and infamie:
As alſo, that by the tenor of the ſaid Letters Patents and Meetings, we
were ſtrictly bound, when or at what time ſoeuer, the Protectors of our
Religion, and of the Vniuerſitie of Prage, (hauing any thing concerning the
ſaid Letters Patents, and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be determined and deliberated
vpon) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with themſelues ſummoned, the Lords of his Maieſties
Councell, and the Iudges of both the Lawes to determine the ſame, there
ſhould ſixe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of each Towne of Prage, as alſo out of euery
other Towne of our Religion, bee called to thoſe Meetings: Which we did not
ſo well know, and that becauſe at thoſe Meetings, Offices in Townes and
Cities of this Realme were oftentimes innouated and changed; as alſo, that by
thoſe of the contrary Religion, that ſate and were mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs,
and by other meanes, we and our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors were much hindred in our
proceedings; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the Emperours Maieſties departure from hence,
expreſſe Commiſsion was giuen vnto the Emperours Officers, all Papiſts,
throughout the Townes of Prage, that they, contrary to all ancient cuſtome,
ſhould take vpon them to enquire of the foundations of the Reformed Churches,
as alſo to deale and meddle with the reuenewes thereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:17011:6"/>that without them and their conſents, we neither
could nor ſhould determine vpon, nor diſpoſe of any cauſe concerning
our Religion in any of our Dioces, as before wee had done: All which tend to
the annihilating of his Maieſties libertie granted vnto vs by his Letters
Patents, and of the Vnion (wherein, among other things, is contained and ſet
downe, that as much as concerning thoſe of the Religion, as alſo their
Churches, that the Emperours Maieſtie ſhould not trouble himſelfe
therewith, but that they of the Religion themſelues, without the Emperour,
ſhould end and determine the ſame) and were thereunto perſwaded by them,
that for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſaid Protectors, hauing twice by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſummoned them to meet, we (contrary to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome) ſent no man of
our Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: but with them of the contrarie Sect, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of
things concerning our Religion (which they ſhould not doe) and further wrote
vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Maieſtie, our Soueraigne King, that wee ſent no ſuch
vnto the Councell to deale or ſpeake for vs, and that ſo we agreed and
conſented vnto their ſaid proceedings. Adding further, that all of vs, with
one full and free conſent, had agreed not to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Protector of our
Cauſe and Religion, but onely the Emperours ſacred Maieſtie: whereby what
iniury might thereby hereafter be done vnto vs, and in the meane time, to all
thoſe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, all men of equall and ſound iudgement may well
ſee.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, perceiuing our ſelues to bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and in an
error; and further, that it was told
<pb facs="tcp:17011:6"/>vs, that as touching the ſupreme defence and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our Religion in this Realme, in our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Bohemian
Confeſſion, which is printed, this is therein openly comprehended and ſet
down; That all the three Eſtates of the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their
Protectors and Conſiſtories, would haue no other Defender nor Protector
(next vnder God) but onely the Emperours Maieſty, our moſt gracious and
Soueraigne King, and thoſe to whom by the conſent and certaine knowledge of
his ſacred Imperiall Maieſty, ſhould by all the three Eſtates of the
reformed Religion, be choſen to haue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and care of their
ſaid Conſiſtories.</p>
            <p>For theſe, and many other iuſt and reaſonable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wee
the ſaid ſuperiour States, haue at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent aſſembled together
in the Caſtle of Prage, both for, and in our names, and for thoſe of all
the three Eſtates of our religion (which haue not refuſed, nor gone backe
from the protection, which for our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is appointed, nor by no meanes
will be drawne from it) by writing to make our reaſonable excuſe in this
caſe, vnto his Imperiall Maieſtie, and therein haue ſo much preuailed,
that they once againe haue all faithfully proteſted to ioyne with vs in the
ſame; &amp; We for our parts haue vndertaken both preſently, &amp;
promiſe in time to come, to maintain and vphold with all our power and might,
euen to the laſt gaſpe, all whatſoeuer belongeth, appertaineth vnto, or
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Emperors Letters Patents, and the Contents thereof, for our
defence, (ſo they bee in ſuch ſort ioyned, as that the one cannot
ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other) and be done with his Imperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
<pb facs="tcp:17011:7"/>conſent. But that we the ſaid three Eſtates of
the reformed Religion may the better charge theſe publike enemies of the
King, their Country, and the peace thereof, and make it apparant what they haue
further practiſed, it is, that contrary to the lawfull proceeding in the
Aſſemblies of the State of the Land to be holden, they haue made and
ordained themſelues as partiall Iudges of his Maieſties ſaid Letters
Patents, Aſſemblies and Vnion: And percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that his ſacred Imperiall
Maieſty, our King &amp; ſoueraigne Lord, is otherwiſe employed in diuers
waighty affaires and buſineſſe concerning the eſtate of Chriſtendome
in generall, and thereby is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remember and thinke vpon all the
immunities and priuiledges, contracts, compacts, and grants concerning the
Realme; that they might ſet his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty at diſcord with the ſayd three
Eſtates of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, and to mooue him to grant ſuch
commiſſion to them, (which without doubt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſaid Letters
Patents,) they haue giuen out by writing to his Maieſty, that in the ſaide
Letters Patents, &amp; contract of Vnion, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that ſuch
ſubiects as are belonging vnto Cloyſters, ſhould haue any right or
authority to build themſelues Churches; whereas that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to
their owne iudgements, but as it is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is committed to both parts,
that is, that if any queſtion ſhould riſe thereof, lawfull iudgement and
determination ſhould be made and giuen therein by an equall number of
perſons of both religions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto purpoſely appointed.</p>
            <p>This notwithſtanding, letting paſſe that manner of
proceeding, at their pleaſures they procured a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb facs="tcp:17011:7"/>from his Maieſty, vnto the Towne of Bruna, to command
them to ſurceaſe from proceeding to build their Churches begun. Which they
of Bruna certifying to the Protectors and Superintendents of our Religion, by
vs made and appointed thereunto, and therein ſought to be holpen, deſiring
&amp; reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, that they might therein bee ayded and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by vertue
of his Maieſties Letters Patents, and the Vnity made at the Aſſembly of
the three Eſtates of the Realme, in the Parliament to that end hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: The
Protectors for their parts, vpon good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and aduice by them taken,
thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to call the principall Officers, Iudges, the Kings
Maieſties Councell of both lawes concerning the reformed Religion, and
withall, ſixe perſons of reſort and Towne (according to the Act of
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their inſtruction therein) to aſſemble and meete
together in Prague, where beeing met, vpon good deliberation they found, that
not onely thoſe of Bruna, but alſo all others that are ſubiect vnto the
Spiritualty within the Realme of Bohemia, (not onely by the Articles which are
in this our Apology ſet downe in Print, but alſo for other reaſons &amp;
cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which here for breuity ſake are omitted) are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipants of, and
ought to enioy the Benefits, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Priuiledges, which belong, and are
giuen by the Emperors Maieſties Letters Patents vnto thoſe of the reformed
Religion: The ſaid Letters Patents among other things ſpecifying (that
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſame, and our ſecurities, no Commiſſion or
Prohibition, which in any ſort might hinder, or let our proceedings, eyther
from his Imperiall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and his Heyres or Succeſſors, Kings of
Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
<pb facs="tcp:17011:8"/>nor by any other whatſoeuer: And that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch
ſhould bee giuen forth or permitted, the ſame ſhould be of no force nor
validity in any ſuch caſe, what pretence or allegation ſoeuer ſhould
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the contrary bee made, ſet downe, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.)</p>
            <p>Whereupon, when we the ſayd three Eſtates and Protectors, vpon
good deliberation and aduice, had made and giuen this anſwer vnto the
inhabitants of Bruna, the Hill townes, and Cloyſters graues which are vnder
the Archbiſhops of Prage, that they ſhuld proceed to the building vp of
their Churches, and in the ſame for the honour of God, vſe their
accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manner of preaching, &amp;c. (alwaies with this condition, that
otherwiſe they ſhould in all things behaue themſelues peaceably,
honeſtly, and ciuilly, and not to ſtirre, moue, nor giue occaſion vnto
any one of the contrary Religion, much leſſe to the Lord Abbot, or the
Archbiſhops, as being their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, of the leaſt cauſe of offence or
motion to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whatſoeuer, either by word or deed, (as knowing well that
the ſame is ſpecially, and expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) but to the contrary, that
they ſhould behaue themſelues towards them in all reaſonable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
concerning worldly and politike matters, as true ſubiects ought to doe.) All
we of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the reformed Religion, at the Aſſembly holden
in the Caſtle of Prage, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of the
Protectors, and vnder our hands in a generall and free Court, did approue,
ratifie, and confirm it, and alſo at that Aſſembly made it known vnto the
Emperors Maieſty, as to our King and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
<pb facs="tcp:17011:8"/>Lord: as alſo diuers and ſundry old wrongs,
oppreſſions, and iniuries which were not only done and committed in the
places aforeſaid touching the Vnion, but alſo to the preiudice of his
Maieſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Royall, vnto the common people, contrary to the
expreſſe meaning of his Maieſties Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, hoping to procure
ſome releefe and redreſſe therein, before our ſaid Aſſembly
ſhould breake vp.</p>
            <p>The ſaid common enemies of the King, the Country, and the Peace
thereof, continuing in their accuſtomed ſecret practices &amp; deuices, and
perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues that they could worke the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Maieſty as
they liſt, they found the meanes that our three Eſtates could in no manner
get any anſwer from his Maieſty therein, before their Aſſembly brake
vp.</p>
            <p>And further, beſides that, certaine perſons by their meanes,
at common and ordinary Aſſemblies, Courts, &amp; expeditions vſed all
manner of hard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and courſes againſt thoſe of the Religion: at
the laſt, they proceeded ſo far, that they brought vpon our three Eſtates
of the Religion, beeing the Emperors Maieſties true and faithfull Subiects,
(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former ouer-heauy burthens layd vpon vs &amp; our poore
ſubiects) for the ſpace of fiue yeares, being moſt great and intolerable
taxations &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions (towards the paying of his Maieſties debts)
which we willingly granted vnto, in hope that the ſame would at length bee a
meanes of vnburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs of our wrongs. This notwithſtanding, after our
Aſſembly was broken vp, (by the ſollicitation of diuers of the Countries
enemies) there could no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb facs="tcp:17011:9"/>from his Maieſty be giuen vnto vs, and much leſſe
any helpe or remedy was to be had therein, but to the contrary, we were rather
daily more &amp; more wronged and oppreſſed, till at the laſt, when his
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Maieſty was ready to depart out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and going
forward on his iourney, lay at the Caſtle of Brandis, (by their procurement)
he called one of the Protectors vnto him, Lord <hi>Henry Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> Earle
of Thurin, at that time Burgraue of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtein, &amp;c. and in the
preſence of two perſons ſaid to him, That hee did not acknowledge nor
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the three Eſtates of the reformed Religions petition concerning
their grieuances, to be true as they alleadged, and that he had reſigned his
autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity concerning the protection of their cauſe vnto the Archbiſhop of
Prague, and that he would be no more troubled therewith. And when the ſaid
Earle of Thurin humbly beſought his Imperiall Maieſty that he would be
pleaſed not to commit the charge of deliuering that meſſage vnto him,
foraſmuch as it concerned all the three Eſtates of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in generall, deſiring his Maieſty that it might pleaſe him to giue order
to the Lord Chancellor then being, to put the ſame in writing, and deliuer it
vnto him, &amp; he would not faile to beare it vnto them to whom it appertained
to deliberate further vpon it: which although his Maieſty granted, and gaue
Commiſſion to the ſaid Lord Chancellor to doe it, yet could not the
ſaid written reſolution from his Maieſty be gotten nor procured from the
Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, notwithſtanding it had beene often required and ſought for at
his hands. And beſides this, the
<pb facs="tcp:17011:9"/>Arch-biſhop of Prage, commanded the new Church at
Cloyſtergraue (the building whereof coſt a great ſumme of money, and
whereunto ſome of the Electors, Princes of Germany, and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men, had
liberally contributed) in contempt of the Goſpell to be defaced, throwne
downe, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſpoiled, and laid euen with the ground: And likewiſe
commanded thoſe of Bruna (contrary to the Vnion) to deliuer their Church vnto
the Abbot, and not to vſe it, and to leaue the keyes thereof in the Chancerie
of Bohemia: which becauſe they denyed to doe, and deſired that they might
ſtill haue the vſe thereof, diuers of the principalleſt perſons among
them were cited to appeare in the Caſtle of Prage, and there with great
weeping, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and clamour, made by their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were held
priſoners.</p>
            <p>This being done, in ſuch manner as you haue heard, and among
many other things, diuers and ſundry grieuances and oppreſſions in
ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſtill were committed and done, and from the ſaid places
certified vnto the Protectors, who by the common people were blamed and taxed,
and charged not to haue done their beſt endeuours to let and withſtand
them: Wee the chiefe Officers, the Kings Maieſties Councell, and Iudges of
both Lawes; as alſo ſixe perſons out of euery Iuriſdiction of the
Religion aſſembled together in Prage at a certaine day thereunto appointed:
where being met, we with them, deliberately conſidering vpon the matter,
deſiring to proceed peaceably and quietly therein, did nothing elſe in that
Aſſembly, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:17011:10"/>agreed, that by ſubmiſſiue Supplications, one
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Regent, the other to his ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, which we ſent
vnto Viana, we would humbly craue that his Maieſtie would bee pleaſed to
ſtay thoſe violent proceedings, and withall to cauſe thoſe Citizens of
Bruna, that were detained priſoners, to be forthwith releaſed: And to that
end alſo we by writing deſired the States of the Marquiſdome of Morauia,
the Princes and States of vpper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Siletia, and the States of the
Marquiſdome of higher and lower Luſuitz, being Prouinces incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated vnto
this Kingdome, that in ſubmiſſiue manner they would vouchſafe to
petition vnto his ſacred Maieſtie for vs. Which done, we preſently agreed
with the Protectors to meet together ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, in the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> the fourth his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Munday after Rogation Sunday
laſt paſt, about the ſame matter, if in the meane time we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued no
anſwer from his Maieſtie of our petition. But vpon the ſaid day, when we
met againe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our determination, we vnderſtood, that in all that
time there was no anſwer, touching the ſame, comne from his Maieſty, and
alſo that our troubles and oppreſſions were not ſtayed, nor
diminiſhed: but to the contrary, by the meanes, procurements, and malice of
our enemies, that his Maieſtie had written a ſharper letter vnto the
Regent, therein not onely blaming the Protectors, but alſo all vs of the
three Eſtates of the Reformed Religion, willing him to certifie the ſame
vnto the Protectors; the Contents thereof being as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, that his ſacred Maieſty the Emperour
<pb facs="tcp:17011:10"/>vnderſtood, and eſteemed, that the ſame our
mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Aſſembly, was wholly done and called, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſupreme
Authority of his Imperiall and Kingly perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That both the demoliſhing of the Church in the Citie of
Cloyſtergraue, and the puniſhing of the diſobedient Citizens of the Towne
of Bruna, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Cloyſter, were both done by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties owne
permiſsion and commandement.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That we had proceeded further in thoſe caſes, then his
Maieſties Letters Patents permitted, or authorized to the States of either of
the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And laſtly, that wee had vſed and retained Strangers
in matters vnlawfull, and that we maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and defended their open
diſobedience and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies againſt his Imperiall Maieſtie, and ſought
to ſupport them therein, which his Maieſtie did little expect at the hands
of ſome of thoſe that were the Authors of thoſe proceedings.</p>
            <p>Adding further (that ſeeing we abuſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
gracious fauour and clemencie, and ſought to proceed further in thoſe
matters then wee ought) his Maieſtie would not faile to looke better into,
and to enquire more thereof; and therein to do iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and to puniſh
euery one of the Offenders in that manner, according to their deſerts:
Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Defenders in the meane time, vntill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties returne
into that Kingdome; or vpon further order therein by him to be taken, not to
ſummon ſuch meetings any more: Withall, willing the Lord Regent, to
certifie and to warne the Towneſ-men
<pb facs="tcp:17011:11"/>and Inhabitants, by any meanes, not to appeare vpon
any ſuch Summons, nor to ioyne with vs, as in the ſaid Letters more at
large appeareth.</p>
            <p>Which Letter, Wee, the ſaid States, little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or
expected; much leſſe, that by the meanes and crafty inſtigation of our
ſaid Enemies, in ſtead of obtaining our requeſt, wee ſhould (without
hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) by his Maieſtie, be iudged faulty, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with condemned as
guilty, as if the matter or cauſe were true indeed, as they vpon bad and
falſe information had, by their Writings, informed his Maieſtie;
perſwading themſelues that if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie (maliciouſly and craftily
informed) in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did auouch, and charge vs, that Wee againſt the
Prerogatiue of his ſacred Imperiall Perſon, and Kingly Authoritie, had
ſummoned and called Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Religion together, and that wee
maintained forraine Subiects in things vniuſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſacred
Maieſtie, and likewiſe vpheld and protected them in their manifeſt
preſumptions and conſpiracies, againſt his Imperiall Dignity, and
ſtrengthened them therein: which things, in the Lawes and Statutes of this
Kingdome, are expreſly (vpon capitall paine and grieuous puniſhment)
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and forbidden.</p>
            <p>Which although we had not done, and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by ſome of
our enemies themſelues cleered thereof, before his Imperiall Maieſtie;
neuertheleſſe (being animated thereby, and hauing the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſaid
Letters in their hands, which they cauſed to be publiſhed and read among
themſelues, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Vs, and our Religion) they ſufficiently
<pb facs="tcp:17011:11"/>ſhewed how ready they were, as ſoone as any of vs
ſhould, by courſe of Law be called in queſtion, for any ſuch cauſe,
before iudgement ſhould paſſe vpon vs (through malice in their hearts
conceiued againſt vs) to verifie and confirme the ſame.</p>
            <p>For it is moſt certaine, that it was done by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in
their ſecret Meetings, and that the Letter was penned by them in Prage, and
ſent vnto his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Maieſtie to ſet his hand thereunto: Whereby it
is euident, that if wee were to be iudged by them, that to their owne ſhame
and confuſion, they could alledge no other thing then this againſt vs. But
when as hitherto they cannot, neither dare openly aſſault or ſet vpon vs,
yet vnder pretence of Right and Iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, they ſeeke to bring vs (that are
honeſt men and his Maieſties true and faithfull Subiects) to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their pleaſures, into vtter ruine, and loſſe of goods, to the great
ſorrow and griefe of our wiues, children, and friends, wholly to extinguiſh
our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And all, whatſoeuer we, by the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties Letters
Patents, as alſo the Concord, Vnion, and Agreement publikely made for our
Religion with thoſe of the contrary ſide in Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and
acknowledged and confirmed to bee a Law and Statute of this Kingdome, wholly to
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate and ouerthrow, and by that meanes to ſtop and bar the Protectors,
and all of vs, (when any danger were likely to fall vpon vs) from daring to
call and aſſemble vs together, to preuent the ſame: Then the which, what
can be more dangerous and perillous vnto vs?</p>
            <p>Which troubles, by them craftily brought vpon
<pb facs="tcp:17011:12"/>vs, and their ſiniſter practices againſt vs, we
ſeeking to eſchew and preuent, when by meanes of their crafty
conſpiracies, wee could haue no anſwer from his ſacred Imperiall
Maieſtie of our humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as alſo that his Maieſtie, by the
ſtrange prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of them, and others their adherents, was ſo perſwaded,
that he beleeued all whatſoeuer they falſely deuiſed and alledged; &amp;
would by no meanes credit, nor heare vs ſpeake for our ſelues: Inſomuch
as that the very name of the Reformed Religion, and Protectors thereof, was
moſt odious in his Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties eares, which they themſelues lewdly were
ſo bold euery where to boaſt and brag of.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, as it is euidently knowne to all men, when they
would call any honeſt man in queſtion, they vſed all the meanes they
could (though it were againſt all right, reaſon, or orderly proceeding) to
bring many men, by ſtrange deuices, into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſſe of life and
goods; ſpecially, ſuch as were of the Reformed Religion: and by their
iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and decrees, made black ſeeme white, and white blacke: the Kings
faithfull and true Subiects, diſloyall; and his diſloyall ſubiects,
iuſt and true; rayſing and aduancing euill and vnfit perſons to
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Eſtates and Dignities; and diſgracing and defaming ſuch as
were worthy of honour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; cruelly handling, and ſtrangely dealing
with, not onely their owne Subiects, but thoſe alſo of the Kingdome, as
well vnder his Maieſties Dominion, as the Spiritualty, for matters of
Religion; and againſt their wils, cruelly (contrary to the manifeſt decrees
of the Vnion) forced and compelled them
<pb facs="tcp:17011:12"/>to be of their Papiſticall Religion: And by the
Kings Iudges menaces and threatnings, brought diuers of the Cities to that
point, that they were compelled, that they ſhould no more vnder-write to be
obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at the Calling and Summons of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, nor
any more to aſſemble and meete together with them; and many other indirect
courſes. And being asked by vs, whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were the Authors
and Deuiſers of the Letter, and condemnation afore-ſaid made againſt vs,
they could not deny it.</p>
            <p>For theſe cauſes aforeſaid, wee haue proceeded againſt two
of their League and Confederacie: the one called <hi>William Slawatam</hi> of
Chulin, and Coſ-chumberk; the other <hi>Iawſlaws Borzita,</hi> of
Martinitz, otherwiſe called <hi>Smetſanckii,</hi> as perturbers and
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of the Lawes and common-peace of the Land: who, for that not
reſpecting their Offices wherein they were placed, haue moſt ſhamefully
and wickedly abuſed the ſame, to the great diſhonour of his ſacred
Imperiall Maieſtie, our ſoueraigne Kings authority, &amp; the breach of the
peace of this Realme, and haue put both of them together, with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie
their Prouoker, &amp; as it were bondſlaue, who with them hath ſowne and
raiſed many factions and ſeditions in the Townes of Prage; hauing firſt

of Bohemia, that are Subiects to the Monaſteries and Clergie of the ſame
Realme, in their reſorts, by the Letters Patents, and the Vnion, contracted
and made betweene thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and the Papiſts, haue
liberty to build themſelues Churches, and freely to exerciſe their Religion
therein, without interruption.</head>
            <p n="1">1 FIRST, it is declared, and expreſly ſet down in his
Maieſties Letters Patents, that all the vnited members of the Reformed
Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lords, and Knights, as alſo thoſe of Prage,
Ruttenbergh, and other Townes, together with their Subiects; and, briefely, all
thoſe that make profeſſion of, and acknowledge the Bohemian
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, no man excepted, ſhall and may freely and peaceably in all

ſuperiour free Eſtates, nor any of the Cities, Townes, nor Country people
ſhall, neither by their Magiſtrates, nor any other perſon whatſoeuer,
Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall or Temporall, be troubled for their ſaid Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, neither by
force or violence be conſtrained or compelled to exerciſe the contrary

            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that againſt the ſaid Priuiledge, no
Counter-mand, nor any other prohibition which may in any ſort be, or
procured, the leaſt impediment or alteration thereof, from his Imperiall
Maieſtie, his Heires and Succeſſors, Kings of Bohemia, ſhall not be
made nor granted: and if any ſuch thing ſhall happen, or be enterpriſed
and taken in hand by any one, it ſhall be of no force nor vigour; neither
ſhall there be any further purſuite thereof made in Law, or otherwiſe
directly or indirectly whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That his Imperiall Maieſtie certifieth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all
ſupreme Officers, both preſent and future, to vnderſtand, that it is his

that profeſſe the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and acknowledge the Bohemian

happen that any Spirituall, or Temporall perſon ſhall doe any thing
contrary to his ſaid Maieſties Letters, or to the end thereby to diſanull
or interrupt the ſame, his ſaid Maieſtie ſhall and will, as alſo his
Heires and Succeſſors, Kings of Bohemia, and the States of this Realme,
euery one of them for their parts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt euery ſuch perſons,
as againſt pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bators of the common Peace and Tranquillity of the Law, and
will defend and protect the ſaid States of the Reformed Religion, in all

            <p n="5">5. And in the Articles of Vnion between both the religions,

Office of the Rowls or Records of the Realme, in <hi>Quaterno Emptionum
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteo, Anno</hi> 1609. it is inſerted in theſe words, That in ſuch
places or Cities vnder the Kings, Queenes, or the Emperors Maieſties

particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, places of burial, nor any places among thoſe of the

in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. Whoſoeuer, vnleſſe it be the Emperors Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty himſelfe,
(whether he be a Spirituall, or a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall perſon, of what dignity or

ſo, and would moleſt them for the ſame, it ſhall bee lawfull for all
the ſayd States of the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to ioyne and ſtand faſt
altogether, and to doe their vttermoſt endeuour to the laſt drop of bloud
in their bodies, for the defence of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Churches, Scholes
&amp; Conſiſtories, and their appurtenances, and to hold and keepe the
ſame for their ſecurity: And that whenſoeuer they or any of their
ſubiects or others of their profeſſion, that are vnder temporall or
ſpiritual iuriſdiction, as aforeſaid, are troubled or vexed, or by any
Magiſtrate aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or aſſailed violently, vnder, or by what meanes
or pretence ſoeuer it be, as if they were ſeditious &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:17011:16"/>Rebels, or otherwiſe, (as the enemies of God and his
Word are wont to doe, and daily practiſe the ſame, as we commonly ſee.)
The ſaid three Eſtates of the reformed Religion in the Kingdome of Bohemia,
vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt motion thereof made vnto them by the Princes &amp; States of
Sileſia, within one month then next after enſuing, ſhall leuie one
thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; two thouſand footmen; at the ſecond time, the
like number; and at the third time, all the forces in Sileſia, to aide and
aſſiſt them: and the like ſhall be done by the Princes and States of
Sileſia, in the Bohemians behalfe, if need require. Which their ſaid
coniunction, action, and vnity, his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Maieſty ſhall fully &amp;
euidently confirm &amp; allow.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In his Maieſties Letters Patents giuen &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to thoſe of Sileſia, it is likewiſe expreſly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and ſet
downe, that all the Subiects of the Prouinces of Sileſia, whether they be
vnder Spiritual or Temporall Princes, Commanders, or hereditary Princes of
Dutchies, Cities, Townes and Villages, and other Magiſtrates, none excepted,
ſhall be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in comprehended, in theſe words: That none of them, whether
they liue vnder ſpirituall or temporall power &amp; iuriſdiction, ſhall
be compelled to vſe any other religion then that they profeſſe, neyther
ſhall bee ſent away, or baniſhed from his dwelling place, nor put from
his office or dignity for religion, or in any ſort vexed, moleſted or
troubled for his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters Patents granted to Sileſia, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ours,
and by vs and our meanes proceeded, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:17011:16"/>were they largelier made to them, then to vs, nor vnto

or meaner condition: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the Articles in our Letters Patents, are
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally &amp; compendiouſly contained, but in the Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Patent, more
expreſly and particularly declared.</p>
            <p n="8">8. At the making of his Maieſties Letters Patents touching
the Vnion, it was not otherwiſe meant nor intended, then that the Cloyſters
are his Imperiall Maieſties princely goods and reuenues, and that he, as the
ſuperior, hath ful power ouer them, as it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently knowne vnto them
that then were preſent at the time of the making of the contract.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That in the Kingdome of Bohemia, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualty haue no
ſingular ſtate as thoſe of Morauia and other Prouinces haue, neyther haue
any voyce in Parliament, but are diſtinguiſhed &amp; ordered by the
Emperors Maieſty among the other States, in all things concerning them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That all Eccleſiaſticall goods be of the
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricke, as alſo of all the reſt by ſuperior right, &amp; are
vnder the power and diſpoſition of the Kings of Bohemia, as the higheſt
and ſupremeſt founders and Patrones thereof.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That the ſame Eccleſiaſticall goods by the
Statutes of the Land, <hi>D.</hi> 40. belong to the Kings Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer or
reuenew; wherefore, according to a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Realm, <hi>Anno</hi> 11. no
Colledge nor Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, without the Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, can alienate or change
any thing belonging thereunto, and if they do pawn, ſell, change, or alienate
any thing thereof, it ſhall be of no force, and that whoſoeuer doth take
any thing
<pb facs="tcp:17011:17"/>of them in that ſort, he ſhall reſtore the
ſame againe freely vnto the King, or to any other to whom it ſhall pleaſe
the King to appoint him to doe it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That Spirituall men are feodaries and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſtrators
of their temporal goods, only for their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and ſo they ought to
vnderſtand it; for that the Kings of Bohemia alwaies had right and power ouer
their ſpirituall goods, to ſell the ſame vnto any of the inhabitants of
the Land, without the conſent of the ſaid Spirituall perſons, and to
alienate and make them hereditary, and to record them for ſuch in the Records
of the Exchequer or Rowles: whereof many examples are extant in the reignes of
<hi>Ferdinando, Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> Emperours and Kings of
Bohemia.</p>
